The younger of the sisters#traded conscious thought#for subconscious desire#and wandered outside for a prayer,#leaving her sister alone with her pets#for the first time in a century

So when she finally returned,#having taught the Buddhists a lesson in serenity#and taken a mask that drew her in with pure emotion#her older sister, worried sick for her#asked her all about the world above

She tried to hide her emotions#She tried to greet her sister each day with a smile#even though she knew Koishi knew a truth#that grew harder to try to hide each day

A shattered plate was the trigger#that let Satori's feelings fly#Koishi running away in tears#knowing her sister was sobbing too

The subconscious memory of her first moments outside#drew Koishi to the site of her original prayer.#Then a prayer for strength,#now a prayer for knowledge,#that Satori might know the world above#even if Koishi could never explain it
